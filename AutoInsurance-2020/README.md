## 2020 Full Coverage Auto Insurance Rates across the United States

If you own a car, then your insurance bill is no doubt part of your budget. Rates can vary by several hundred dollars depending on where you live, and it turns out, the difference between full and minimal coverage makes a big difference too.

We found the data for our visualization at ValuePenguin- a cost and financial product comparison website. We pulled together both full and minimal coverage averages for each state, ranking from highest to lowest in a spiral stacked bar chart. 

•	Minimal coverage is defined for these purposes as the least amount of insurance a motorist can carry and still legally operate a vehicle. 
•	Full coverage means also taking on collision and comprehensive coverage above the minimum, as well as extra liability coverage.

Suffice it to say, this approach lets you easily see an apples-to-apples comparison of auto insurance rates around the country.
