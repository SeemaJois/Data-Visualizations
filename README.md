# Data Visualizations- Drive actions through insights

Insights on how we visualize and analyze data from multiple topics - one chart at a time.

The most advanced analytics outcomes are worthless if they don’t find adoption and drive actions that lead to outcomes. Indeed, as the tech around analytics and AI becomes more widely understood and moves towards the mainstream of businesses, it is, thus, vital to understand a user’s context, needs — their own stories, if you will — and deliver analytics insights within that narrative in a way that empowers them to act.  

By applying Design Thinking and Human Centred Design methodologies, we can invent compelling solutions that help users understand the real implications of analytics insights and gives them the right information in the right context.
